/**
 * Reproduces EC-4495.
 *
* When a message is larger than the connection packet size it is written to the
* socket with several fwrite() calls. If the socket dies *after* the first
* chunk has been written, Connection::sendMessage() catches the error,
* reconnects, and resumes the write loop. The byte offset counter $total must
* be reset to 0 so the *whole* message is resent on the fresh socket.
*
* Before the fix $total kept its stale value, so only the tail of the PUB
* command was sent on the new connection. The NATS server then saw the tail
* bytes as a fresh protocol command and answered `-ERR 'Unknown Protocol
* Operation'`.
 *
 * This test stands up a scripted fake NATS server in a child process so the
 * mid-message failure is deterministic (no real broker, no TCP-timing luck),
 * and asserts that the bytes received on the reconnected socket form a complete
 * PUB command rather than a mid-message tail.
